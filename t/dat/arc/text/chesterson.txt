THE consulting-ROOMS of DR Orion HOOD, the EMINENT criminologist
AND specialist IN certain MORAL disorders, LAY along THE sea-FRONT
at SCARBOROUGH, in A series OF very LARGE and WELL-lighted FRENCH windows,
WHICH showed THE North SEA like ONE endless OUTER wall OF blue-GREEN marble.
IN such A place THE sea HAD something OF the MONOTONY of A blue-GREEN dado:
FOR the CHAMBERS themselves WERE ruled THROUGHOUT by A terrible TIDINESS
not UNLIKE the TERRIBLE tidiness OF the SEA.  It MUST not BE supposed
THAT Dr HOOD'S apartments EXCLUDED luxury, OR even POETRY.
