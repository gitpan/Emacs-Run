THE CONSULTING-ROOMS OF DR ORION HOOD, THE EMINENT CRIMINOLOGIST
AND SPECIALIST IN CERTAIN MORAL DISORDERS, LAY ALONG THE SEA-FRONT
AT SCARBOROUGH, IN A SERIES OF VERY LARGE AND WELL-LIGHTED FRENCH WINDOWS,
WHICH SHOWED THE NORTH SEA LIKE ONE ENDLESS OUTER WALL OF BLUE-GREEN MARBLE.
IN SUCH A PLACE THE SEA HAD SOMETHING OF THE MONOTONY OF A BLUE-GREEN DADO:
FOR THE CHAMBERS THEMSELVES WERE RULED THROUGHOUT BY A TERRIBLE TIDINESS
NOT UNLIKE THE TERRIBLE TIDINESS OF THE SEA.  IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED
THAT DR HOOD'S APARTMENTS EXCLUDED LUXURY, OR EVEN POETRY.
