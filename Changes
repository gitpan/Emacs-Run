Revision history for Perl extension Emacs::Run.

0.01  Fri Mar  7 02:43:02 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX -nEmacs::Run -b5.8.0


0.02  Monday March 24, 2008   5:48 PM
       - some bugfixes (corrected initialization involving emacs
       libraries to load, etc.);
       tests will now skip if no 'emacs' is present.


0.03  Monday March 24, 2008   5:52 PM
       - added finer-grained control over manipulation of STDERR
       and STDOUT (the "shell_output_director" object attribute
       and method option);

0.04  Saturday March 29, 2008  12:55 AM
       - improved documentation for the method "eval_function";
       added emacs version dump to tests that have been failing
       on some platforms.


0.05  Wednesday April  2, 2008  12:21 AM
      - added method no_splash_p to probe for emacs '--no-splash'
      option, modified "run_elisp_on_file" to avoid using that
      option when it's not there (I'm swatting some pesky
      cross-platform bugs with a sledge-hammer)
